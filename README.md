# Scenario

This Project is the frontend of an interview coding challenge. There are three major steps involved with this challenge:

## Step 1: Connect all frontend components to the central Task Service task list data

Currently, our app has three functional components that all work with some variation of task data, but they are not sharing that data between components. Your first step is to connect each of the three components in question (TaskDisplay, TaskCreate, and TaskDelete) to the TaskService data so that each component's behavior affects the data of the other datasets.

## Step 2: Connect the TaskService methods with data managed by the backend half of this project

Once you have connected our components the TaskService, your next objective is to connect the TaskService to the backend half of the project (setup <a href="https://github.com/roesnera/Interview_Challenge_Backend">here</a>). The backend is already set up with a basic node/express server with routes for GET, POST, and DELETE. Your final objective can be found on the backend

## After all steps complete

Once you have completed all the steps in both components, take about 15 minutes to jot down some thoughts on how you would improve the approach of this project moving forward. Concrete, actionable ideas strongly preferred!
