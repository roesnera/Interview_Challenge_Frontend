# Scenario

This Project is the frontend of an interview coding challenge (<a href="https://github.com/roesnera/Interview_Challenge_backend">backend here</a>). We have provided these starter files to serve as a starting point. You are not required to use these files if you are more comfortable starting your own project or working in a different framework.

## Challenge:

We have provided the initial structure for a TODO list. Most components have been pre-wired for you. We expect you to:
<ol>
  <li>finish writing the task-update component</li>
  <li>implement the updateTask function inside task.service.ts</li>
  <li>implement a put route on the backend in the app.ts file</li>
</ol>
