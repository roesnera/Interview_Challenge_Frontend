# Scenario

This Project is the frontend of an interview coding challenge. We have provided these starter files to serve as a starting point. You are not required to use these files if you are more comfortable starting your own project or working in a different framework, but the final product must meet the three requirements listed for this project and complete the challenge to the best of your ability. The requirements are as follows

## Requirement 1: All frontend components must share data

The frontend components must all work with the same data.

## Requirement 2: Frontend data must connect to the backend

The frontend must store and retrieve data from the backend.

## Requirement 3: Backend data must persist in a database

The backend must persist its data in a database.

## Challenge:

We have provided the initial structure for a TODO list. Most components have been pre-wired for you. We expect you to finish writing the task-update component and the updateTask function inside task.service.ts

## After all steps complete

Once you have completed all the steps in both components, take about 15 minutes to jot down some thoughts on how you would improve the approach of this project moving forward. Concrete, actionable ideas strongly preferred!
